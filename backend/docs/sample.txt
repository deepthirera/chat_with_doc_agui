Introduction to AG-UI Protocol

AG-UI (Agent-User Interaction Protocol) is an open, event-based protocol designed to enable dynamic communication between agentic frontends and backends.

Key Features:
- Event-based architecture with ~16 standard event types
- Supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSocket transport
- Bidirectional communication between agents and UIs
- Lifecycle management (RUN_STARTED, RUN_FINISHED)
- Streaming text messages (TEXT_MESSAGE_START, TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT, TEXT_MESSAGE_END)
- Tool call coordination
- State synchronization

Use Cases:
- AI chatbots with streaming responses
- Agent-driven user interfaces

- Multi-step agent workflows

The protocol is MIT licensed and maintained by CopilotKit, with support for React, Vue, Angular, and other modern frameworks.

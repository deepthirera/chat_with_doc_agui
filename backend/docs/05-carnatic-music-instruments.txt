Instruments in Carnatic Music

Carnatic music features a distinctive ensemble of instruments, each playing specific roles in performance. The veena, a plucked string instrument, is considered the most ancient and revered instrument in the tradition. It has seven strings and 24 frets, allowing for subtle microtonal variations essential to raga expression. The veena's rich, resonant tone makes it ideal for both solo performances and accompaniment.

The violin entered Carnatic music during the 18th century and has become an integral part of the tradition. Unlike Western classical violin playing, Carnatic violinists sit on the floor with the instrument held against the chest and shoulder. The violin's versatility in producing gamakas (ornamentations) and its wide tonal range make it perfectly suited for replicating vocal nuances. Today, violin accompaniment is standard in most Carnatic vocal concerts.

Percussion instruments form the rhythmic backbone of Carnatic ensembles. The mridangam, a barrel-shaped double-headed drum, is the primary percussion instrument, providing both rhythm maintenance and improvised rhythmic solos called tani avartanams. The ghatam (clay pot), kanjira (frame drum), and morsing (jaw harp) often join the mridangam in concerts, creating complex polyrhythmic textures. The tambura provides the drone, establishing the tonal foundation over which melodies unfold, creating the characteristic sonic landscape of Carnatic music.
